[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sohrabhamza/colab-torrent-downloader/blob/main/SimpleTorrentDownloader.ipynb)
A simple ibnyp to download [legal] torrent directly into your google drive.

# Features
Simple. 
Downloads directly to a "torrent" folder in your gdrive.
Shows you what files you will be downloading before starting. 
Based on libtorrent. 

# Instructions
Click on the "open in colab" button.
Run each cell one by one. You can choose to input either a .torrent file or a magnet url. 

# How is this different from other downloaders?
I was mainly focused on simplifying the process and making it as easy as possible to run. 

# Credits
The bulk of this script is from [nishan7/Google-Colab-Torrent-Downloader](https://github.com/nishan7/Google-Colab-Torrent-Downloader). 
I did not fork it because I plan to rewrite the core logic and possibly even change the torrent downloader. Might even include a torrent scraper.
